          Furever was born from a simple yet profound understanding: our pets are family, and their memory deserves to be cherished forever. We started this journey in 2024 with a mission to create a gentle, beautiful space where pet parents could celebrate and remember their beloved companions.

          <p>
            We envision a world where every pet's story can be preserved and shared in a meaningful way. Where memories bring comfort, and where pet parents can find support in their journey of remembrance.

          At Furever, we believe that every pet leaves paw prints on our hearts. Whether they were with us for years or just a brief moment, their impact on our lives deserves to be honored and remembered.
